(1) q2 + q7 + z89 + 1 == 2*q2*q7 + 2*z910 + 4*z911
(2) 2*z910 + 4*z911 == z89 + 2
(3) z810 + z910 + 2*z911 == 1

What's needed to solve:

Looking at (2) or (3), it's clear z911 = 0
Looking at parity of (2), z89 = 0
With z89 = 0, from (1) we see q2 + q7 = 1, which gives the relationship we are looking for
