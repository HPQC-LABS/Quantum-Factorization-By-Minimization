This version doesn't make any assumptions but instead keeps track of how many qubits are possible and how many are solved, then reports this and writes the final equations.

.\PrimeFactorizationEquationGenerator.py  4 4 3454 filename.txt

4 4 - the length in binary of p and q
3454 - the number to be factored
filename.txt - the file to append the output to
